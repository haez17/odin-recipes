So for this project I am on my work computer, remote desktopped into my personal computer, running a virtual computer. Whilst doing this, I am creating a website that will be called odin-recipes for The Odin Project. I have learned quite a bit just from my practice last night and do thoroughly enjoy learning this stuff.  One day, I will be getting paid to do what I love to do. And even when that happens, I will be furthering my knowledge to unknown levels.
